## Design Approach
### Problem Solved
- Home Page
    - Added images of common problems people face, exactly for which skincare is considered by so many, invoking a sense of relatibility and trust.
    - Immediately after grabbing their attention with a question hook (concern images, "or Want FLAWLESS skin & hairs ?"), we added a clear-cut CTA by providing out products as solutions (irresistible-offer) to their problems and adding a "Shop Now" button.
    - The Image depicts a model with an ideal, perfect skin which people aspire to obtain.
    - Addressed alignment issues for seamless display across all screen sizes.
    - Ensured images remain consistent and "non-duplicated/tiled" on various devices.
    - Enhanced readability by optimizing spacing and margins, particularly beneficial on different screen-sizes.

- Cant' Doubt our Products (from og website - "The future of personal care is here" section)
    - By statement of straight-forward, short and bold title, we have ensured to attract attention and get the trust before they scroll further.
    - In the original website, this section was pulled down, but we believe benfits section which also states brand's values is extremely important,  and should be kept at the top.
    - For confused buyers/visitors, brand has offered a detailed quiz, which was originally confused with several names and path, but we have clearly mentioned it as a quiz which is a straight option for visitors.

- Our Best Sellers
    - Each picture can be slided in the original website, a feature which we found unnecesaary and interfering with scroll-usability, has been therefore removed.
    - due to close padding of information, the emphasis of benefits has got suppressed which won't grab attention of visitors and give them a motivation to decide upon purchase leading to lower sales. The small-size of pricing is a readabiity issue.
    - the stars have been removed, cuz as per original score, all the products seem to have similar amount of stars which puts a question mark on the creadibility of ratings, lower stars might even create a inferior percieved image of product. Additionally due to similarity, there's no parameter for comparision of products based on reviews, specially on similar products like cleanser-variants.
